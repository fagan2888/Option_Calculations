# Option_Calculations
Python scripts to calculate a couple of options (financial derivatives) and Implied Volatilities for American and European options

# Leisen-Reimer.py
With the Leisen-Reimer.py script you are able to calculate the price for European- and American Plain-vanilla options. There is also a functionality to return the delta, gamma and a list of the price, delta and gamma. This code is transalted from a VBA code in the book "The Complete Guide to Option Pricing Formulas" by Espen Gaarder Haug.

# Future updates
In the near future I will upload a Implied Volatility calculator based on Leisen-Reimer (European and American) and Black-Scholes (European). Furthermore also a script to calculate the value of barrier options with the Black-Scholes formulas.
