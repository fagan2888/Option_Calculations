# Option_Calculations
Python scripts to calculate a couple of options (financial derivatives) and Implied Volatilities for American and European options

#Leisen-Reimer.py
With the Leisen-Reimer.py script you are able to calculate the price for European- and American Plain-vanilla options.
There is also a functionality to return the delta, gamma and a list of the price, delta and gamma.
In the near future I will also upload a version for which you are able to determine te IV with Leisen-Reimer.
